 * These types should really be exported to WASM and used directly instead of being redefined

 *
 * Following bugs limit the ability to do so:
 * - Can't export Vec<T> where T is an exported type: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/111
 * - Forced to use a C-style enum due to https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2407
